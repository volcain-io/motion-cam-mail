# Motion Cam Mail

A Raspberry Pi based tiny security system with motion detection, camera,
email notification and Dropbox & IFTTT support. In default the script sends an
email as soon as the motion sensor is triggered and is capturing continuously
images for a period of 60 seconds with a delay of 10 seconds (10 pictures per minute).
